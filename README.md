AlertEye: Real-Time Drowsiness Detection System

AlertEye is a Python-based project designed to detect driver drowsiness in real-time, using computer vision and machine learning techniques. By analyzing facial landmarks and eye movements, AlertEye identifies signs of fatigue and alerts the user before they fall asleep at the wheel.
Features

    Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) Analysis: Detects prolonged eye closure, a primary indicator of drowsiness.
    Real-Time Video Processing: Utilizes the webcam feed to analyze facial expressions in real-time.
    Alert Mechanism: Sends alerts (visual or auditory) when drowsiness is detected.

Installation & Usage
